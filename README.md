# typeScriptStudies

Welcome to my TypeScript Study Repository!

In this GitHub repository, I have compiled all my work related to TypeScript,
a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other valuable features to the language.

## What is inside?

Here, you will find a collection of code samples, and study notes that I have created
during my journey to learn and master TypeScript.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It extends JavaScript by introducing optional static typing and additional features, making it a more robust and scalable language for building complex applications.

## Key Features of TypeScript:

1. Types:
   TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to specify data types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This enables catching type-related errors during compile-time, leading to improved code quality and fewer bugs.

2. Interfaces:
   Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure of an object, specifying the names and types of its properties. They promote code reusability and consistency across different parts of the codebase.

3. Classes:
   TypeScript supports class-based object-oriented programming. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects with predefined properties and methods, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

4. Generics:
   Generics enable the creation of reusable components that can work with various data types. They facilitate the development of flexible and type-safe functions and classes.

5. Decorators:
   Decorators are a powerful feature used to modify classes, methods, or properties at declaration time. They are often employed in frameworks like Angular for adding metadata, logging, or behavior to classes.

By leveraging these key features of TypeScript, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone code in your projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will serve as a valuable resource for your TypeScript learning journey.

Feel free to explore the code samples and study notes I have compiled during my TypeScript studies. Happy learning!
