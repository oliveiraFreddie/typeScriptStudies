# typeScriptStudies

Welcome to my TypeScript Study Repository!

In this GitHub repository, I have compiled all my work related to TypeScript, 
a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other valuable features to the language. 

## What is inside?

Here, you will find a collection of projects, code samples, and study notes that I have created 
during my journey to learn and master TypeScript.
